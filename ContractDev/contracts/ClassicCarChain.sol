	/// Cool ideas to consider:
    
	
	// - [ ] Highlight categories. Different categories have different fields, such as "maintenance" and "expert review"
    // - [ ] Consider if the entire car could be sold with a function in this contract?
    // - [ ] How about auctioning the car within this contract? Giving users the ability to bid on the car?
    // Potential feature-creep -problem if I add auctioning as a part of this.
	// - [ ] Ping-pong bidding ability between the owner and the requester. 
	// The requester asks for money, the owner sends a counter-offer and a round of counter-offers are made
	// Each side can accept in turn or reject the transaction.
	// - [ ] Simplified highlight adding for the vehicle owner. The owner should not have to use the more complex system of requesting for a reward, the same way that other people do.
	// - [x] A spam-avoidance system. The owner should be able to give highlight request rights to specific addresses. 
	// - [x] A way to delete unwanted highlights from the chain. This is in case if the former owner of the car made
	// highlights on nights when they were drunk. A deletion should be publically broadcast to the block chain,
	// none the less. This is to prevent deleting highlights dishonestly.
	// - [x] A settings enumerator. If the vehicle becomes unpopular, the owner has no reason to give away highligh request rights.
	// This is just to make the it easier for the owner to accept requests.
