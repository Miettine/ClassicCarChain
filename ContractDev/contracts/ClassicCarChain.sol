	/// Cool ideas to consider:
    
    // - Consider if the entire car could be sold with a function in this contract?
    // - How about auctioning the car within this contract? Giving users the ability to bid on the car?
    // Potential feature-creep -problem if I add auctioning as a part of this.
	// - Some ping-pong bidding ability between the owner and the requester. 
	// The requester asks for money, the owner sends a counter-offer and a round of counter-offers are made
	// Each side can accept in turn or reject the transaction.
	// - A spam-avoidance system. The owner should be able to give highlight request rights to specific addresses. 
	// If a contract like this were to become very popular in the future, the 
	// - A way to delete unwanted highlights from the chain. This is in case if the former owner of the car made
	// highlights on nights when they were drunk. A deletion should be publically broadcast to the block chain,
	// none the less. This is to prevent deleting highlights dishonestly.
	// - A settings enumerator. If the vehicle becomes unpopular, the owner has no reason to give away highligh request rights.
	// This is just to make the it easier for the owner to accept requests.
