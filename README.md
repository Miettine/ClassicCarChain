# ClassicCarChain

Greetings,

What you see here is a work-in-progress project that will utilize the Ethereum block chain. (In-depth description will be added later)

This project will be a thesis for software development studies at Oulu University of Applied Sciences.

The documentation of this project will be primarily in Finnish, with an exception being a poster that will be created near the end of the project. The poster will be in English. Code comments and documentation will be in English, as well.

# Starting Classic Car Chain on the local machine

## Required software

- Some way to run a local Ethereum-node on your machine. You can use a Geth-executable or testrpc (see below).

- The files of this repository on your local computer.

- [Meteor-framework](https://www.meteor.com/)

- Any web browser

### Recommended software

- [testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) is a node server application that runs on the local computer. It follows the functionality of the Ethereum-blockchain very closely. Good for purposes of developing or demoing the application.

- Truffle is a framework for assisting in the development of Ethereum-smart contracts. It works well with testrpc or a test network geth-node running on the local machine. Truffle allows you to quickly and easily deploy the contract into the network.

- [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is recommended if you wish to use testrpc or truffle.

## Instructions

### 1. Make sure that the application's web3 has a provider.

If you are aiming to remotely contact a geth-node on another computer, you will need to modify the code a little bit. In your local repository, Go to \ClassicCarChain\client\lib\ethereum\02-second\01-start. Modify the file 01-init.js and change the address of the web3-provider into the address where your remote geth-node is running. (This functionality is untested)

If you only wish to run this application locally, start a geth-executable or testrpc on your local machine.

### 2. Deploy the contract

You may use web3, ethereum wallet, mist, the truffle framework's deployer or whatever you wish. You can find the contract's solidity-code (ClassicCarChain.sol) in ContractDev/contract/.

If you have the truffle framework installed and wish to use it to deploy the contract into your network, navigate to ContractDev/ in the command line (git bash is good if you are using truffle on windows) and run the command: 'truffle migrate'

Once the contract is deployed, copy its address.

### 4. Start Meteor

Using the command line, navigate into the folder Meteor/ClassicCarChain/ in this repository. Start meteor with the 'meteor' -command.

### 5. Open the app in a web browser

In a web-browser, go to the address http://localhost:3000/[address]/contract/ Paste your contract address into '[address]'.

### 6. Enjoy!
