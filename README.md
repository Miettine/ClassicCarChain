# ClassicCarChain

Greetings,

What you see here is a work-in-progress project that will utilize the Ethereum block chain. (In-depth description will be added later)

This project will be a thesis for software development studies at Oulu University of Applied Sciences.

The documentation of this project will be primarily in Finnish, with an exception being a poster that will be created near the end of the project. The poster will be in English. Code comments and documentation will be in English, as well.
